2) Download necessary images and files.
Run: ./download.sh

3) Open new terminal window and launch sensor QEMU
Run: ./launch_sensor.sh

4) Open new terminal window and launch Android emulator

This will perform the following steps - 
(i) Send test.wav from host to sensor
(ii) Sensor will encode and return test.mp3 file back to host
(iii) Host will send the MP3 file to Android and the server. At this time, the Android application will update itself with the location and audio file. Tap on the marker to interact with it. 
(iv) Host will then retrieve the tags from server and send it to Android. At this time, hitting "Auto-Tag?" in the application will display the tags

8) Search
Open Lifelogs application in Android Emulator, Hit Search Button and enter keyword
This will perform the following steps -
