Phase 1:
Sensor - Debian OS on ARM Platform (plain QEMU)
Phone - Android Emulator (Target API 22)
Server - Ubuntu Server OS on x86 Platform (plain QEMU) 

Steps to perform Phase 1 (in Terminal Window):

1) Set the correct paths in paths.sh

2) Download necessary images and files.
Run: ./download.sh

3) Launch all VMs
Run: ./launch_all.sh
Internally, this runs the following:
	i) Launch sensor QEMU (./launch_sensor.sh)
	ii) Launch Android emulator (./launch_phone.sh)
	iii) Launch server QEMU (./launch_server.sh)
	iv) Launch watcher (./start_watcher.sh)

4) Once the Android emulator is up and running
Edit ssh.txt and enter the username and password of your host machine
1st line is username.
2nd line is password.
Make sure you don't press enter after the 2nd line.

5) In terminal window
Run: ./send_ssh_creds.sh
This will transfer the ssh.txt file to the Android device so that our application can access it.

6) Blog
Open Lifelogs application in Android Emulator, Hit Blog Button
This will perform the following steps - 
(i) Send test.wav from host to sensor
(ii) Sensor will encode and return test.mp3 file back to host
(iii) Host will send the MP3 file to Android and the server. At this time, the Android application will update itself with the location and audio file. Tap on the marker to interact with it. 
(iv) Host will then retrieve the tags from server and send it to Android. At this time, hitting "Auto-Tag?" in the application will display the tags

7) Search
Open Lifelogs application in Android Emulator, Hit Search Button and enter keyword
This will perform the following steps - 
(i) Get keyword file from Android to host
(ii) Send keyword file to server
(iii) Retrieve relevant metadata from server to host
(iv) Send metadata from host to Android

8) To kill all the VMs and associated processes:
Open terminal window and run: ./terminate_vm.sh
